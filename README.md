# 30 MFF Website: Lending a Hand

### Description: 
In this project, I have created a website that houses and debuts our film with the title: Lending a Hand. The film teaches about problem solving by being 
compassionate and offer help whenever we can. Thus, my goal was to incorporate the film's main message with my website design.

### Process:
To achieve my goal, I used a picture of heart made by volunteer hands as the main image of the home page of my website. This image shows a link to the title of the film displayed
in the middle of the heart. Moreover, this image is also very helpful in conveying the main theme of the film. Then, I used a light blue-purple gradient for the background
as it looked good with the image. For the synopsis page, I used another picture conveying the idea of solving problems by helping each other.

### Reflection Evaluation:
I kept building on my initial concept about showing the story of film using my websie design. There were a few updates on my previous ideas, like using a picture of heart
of hands in the middle rather than occupying whole background for hands in order to make room for interactive side menu. I also added a cast page. But all my goals and
expectations were met at the end.
